**Basketball game with the Ursina game.**
The game features a fun prototype with ball toss, animations, user input and other details.

What did I use to develop this game:

          Ursina game engine basics
          Basketball ball movement and physics rules
          Game control via user login
          Animation use and integration
          Particle effects used Panda3D particles

What considerations I want add this game:

          More gameplay mechanics, such as scoring systems, player stats, or different game modes.
          Implement multiplayer functionality 
          Add rigidbodyclass to integrate physics
